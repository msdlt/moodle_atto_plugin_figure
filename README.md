# moodle_atto_plugin_figure

a Moodle plugin for the Atto editor.

This plugin inserts the HTML5 Figure element into text with an image.

Developed for University of Oxford Medical Sciences Office by Will Hanrott, Nov
2016. Adapted from [/image/ pluging for Atto](https://github.com/moodle/moodle/tree/master/lib/editor/atto/plugins/image).

This plugin is still in development so I've excluded the yui/build directory. You
will have to run <code>sudo -u www-data grunt shifter</code> on the target system
to build the JavaScript plugin fully.
